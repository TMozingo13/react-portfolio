           Iâ€™m a Computer Science major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. After my freshman year
           I  had an internship working as as Software Developer. It was there during a technology 
           career panel that I learned about UI/UX design. I knew that I had found a path that could 
           combine my strong interests in design and technology. Since then, I have spent my time developing 
           my skills and passion for UI/UX design and hope to pursue it as a career. In my freetime I love to 
           sew and keep up with fashion.
